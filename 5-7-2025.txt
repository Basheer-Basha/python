1. what is data type in python?
     A data type is a classification of data that determines the type of value a variable can hold and the
     operations that can be performed on it.

2. List all the data types that we have in python?
   # Data Type                 Example Description
     1.Int                            10                         whole numbers     
     2.Float                          7.5                        decimal numbers
     3.Complex                        2+7j                       complex numbers(real+imaginary)
     4.String                        "hello"                     text(string)
     5.Boolean                      True,False                   boolean values
     6.list                         [1,2,3]                      ordered changeble collection
     7.Touple                       (1,2,3)                      ordered unchangable collection
     8.dictionary                    {1:"a"}                     key-value pairs
     9.set                          {1,2,3}                      unordered collection with no duplicates

3. what is the differences between mutable and immutable data types?
  mutable data type:
        A mutable data type is a type of data that can be modified or changed after it is created.
         these data types allow for additions,modified of their contents.
     ex types: list,dict,set
        list=[1,2,3]
        list[0]=50
        print(list)
        output:[50,2,3]

   Immutable data type: 
        An immutable data type is a type of data that cannot be modefied or changed after it is created.
      ex types: int,float,str,tuple,boolean,None,complex.
         str="hello"
         str=str+"world"
         print(str)
         output:"hello world"

 4. what is difference between int,float and complex?
    int:1.Whole numbers
        2.no decimal points
        3.only real parts
       syntax: x=5
      Ex: |'1','2','-3'|

    float:1.decimal numbers
          2.onlt real parts    
         syntax:x=3.3,0.5
      Ex: |1.5',-13.5'|

    complex:1.numbers with real and imaginary parts
            2.used for mathematical operations involving imaginary numbers
            3.Real and imaginary parts
          syntax:x=1+3j,-2+3j
       Ex:|'2+-3j','-3-4j'|

5.which data type is used to represent text in python?
   The data type used to represent text in python is the string type.
     ex: name="basheer"
         print(type (name))   
       output:<class 'str'>

6. what is the output of type(521) and type("521")?
    print(type(521))
    print(type("521"))      
    output:<class 'int'>
           <class 'str'>

7. what is the differences between list,tuple and set?
  List: 
       1.List is ordered collection of heterogenious elements.
       2.It is mutable (can change ,add, or remove elements)
       3.It is allow duplicates values
       4.It is represented as square brackets " [] "
     ex: list=[1,2,4]

   Touple:
        1.Touple is a ordered collection of items.
        2.It is immutable (cannot be modified)
        3.It is allow duplicate values      
        4.It is represented as "()" brackets.
      ex: touple=(1,2,3)
   set:
       1.Set is a unordered collection of unique items.
       2.It is mutable(can be modified)
       3.It is does not allow duplicate values.
       4.It is represented as curly '{}' brackets.
      ex: set={1,22,3,}                  

8. How is a dictionary different from a list?
     A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, whereas a list is a collection of single values.

9. What is the default data type of a number with a decimal point?
     Any number written witha decimal point is treated as a 'floating-point' number by default.     

10.Declares variables of type int,float,string amd complex?
      a=10
      b=20.0
      c=2+3j
      d="basheer"
      print(type(a))
      print(type(b))
      print(type(c))
      print(type(d))

11.Take any 3 datatypes example and check type of each variable using the type() function?
     
      basheer=(1,2,3)
      srinu=[4,5,6]
      abdul={1:"sai",2:"kiran"}
      print(type(basheer))
      print(type(srinu))
      print(type(abdul))

12.What happens if you try to add a string and an integer?
       
       basheer="hello"
       print(basheer+" world")
     output: hello world

13.What is the output of :1.x=[1,2,3]
                          2.y=(1,2,3)
                          3.z={1,2,3}

     x=[1,2,3]
     y=(1,2,3)
     z={1,2,3}
     print(x)  
     print(y)
     print(z)
     print(type(x))
     print(type(y))
     print(type(z))

   output: [1,2,3]
           (1,2,3)
           {1,2,3}
           <class 'list'>
           <class 'touple'>
           <class 'set'>

14.Can you change a value in a touple once it is defined? why or why not?
    1.No, Tuples in python are immutable,meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation.
    2.If you try to change a value in a touple,you'll get a 'TypeError':
       name=(1,2,3)
       name[0]=5
       print(name)
      output: 'TypeError'

15.Is reassignment possible for immutable datatypes?
    1.Yes, Reassignment is possible for immutable data types.
    2.Even though the value itself can't be changed,the variable van be reassigned to a new value.

   Ex: basheer="abdulla"
       basheer="kiran"
       print(basheer)
     output: kiran
